# SCORE
SCORE (Synthesis od COnsists as Rolling Energy micro-grids) is a web-based application that enables the exploration and trade-offs that exist in complex system of consists, routes, and policies used by the Class 1 railroad system.

## Background
SCORE is a comprehensive set of open source tools tailored to the modeling oenergy trades that can be provided to industry and organizations developing advanced energy solutions, to evaluate their efficacy in teh context of a *transportation system*. Yet open source software tools do not exist to eplore and evaluate advanced energy and powering technologies that can reduce environmental impacts at an acceptabel cost. Current data for rail lines, locomotives, and rail cars is industry owned and controlled, hindering access to historical costs, emissions, and traffic. Existing Longitudinal Train Dynamics (LTD) models are not open source, and are not tailored for energy analysis. SCORE provides an Energy Longitudinal Train Dynamics (E-LTD) model that treats the train or consist as a rolling micro-grid, capable of managing energy flows from the complex network of sources and sinks.
